### Introduction to Open Space Principles

Explain the unconference format, emphasizing its foundation on open space technology, which allows for a flexible agenda driven by participant input. Outline the four principles and one law guiding Open Space:

1. **Whoever Comes Is the Right People**: Valuing every participant's contribution.
2. **Whatever Happens Is the Only Thing That Could Have**: Embracing the event's flow.
3. **When It Starts Is the Right Time**: Appreciating spontaneity.
4. **When It’s Over, It’s Over**: Respecting discussions' natural conclusion.

### Law of Mobility

- Highlight participants' freedom to choose their sessions and move if they're not engaged.

### Marketplace

- Arrange a collaborative agenda-setting with post-its for session proposals.
- Allow participants to present topics and form the agenda collectively, emphasizing equipment availability in certain rooms.
- Encourage ongoing discussions to relocate if necessary to avoid session interruptions.

## Time Management

- Inform participants about session timings.
- Facilitate the transition of discussions to new spaces as needed, ensuring a smooth flow of the event.
