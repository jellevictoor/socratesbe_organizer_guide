# Open Space Event Facilitation Guide

## Opening Remarks
- Welcome participants warmly.
- Express gratitude to the venue host.
- Share practical information (e.g., restrooms, emergency exits).

## Introduction to Open Space Principles
1. **Whoever Comes Is the Right People**: Emphasize the value each person brings.
2. **Whatever Happens Is the Only Thing That Could Have**: Encourage openness to the flow of the event.
3. **When It Starts Is the Right Time**: Highlight the importance of spontaneity.
4. **When It’s Over, It’s Over**: Advise participants to respect the natural end of discussions.

## Law of Freedom
- Explain participants' empowerment to choose their sessions and move freely if they feel they are not learning or contributing.

## Structure of the Event
### Lightning Talks
- Brief, inspiring sessions to kickstart ideas. (max 7 minutes)

### Marketplace
- Line out the number of rooms times the amount of slots.
- if there are rooms with beamers or other needed equipment, highlight those on the agenda
- Collaborative agenda-setting for breakout discussions.
  - Use post-its and markers for topic proposals.
  - Facilitate a process for presenting and selecting topics. People queue up, present 1 proposal for session, if they have multiple, they re-queue
  - All post-its are placed inside the parking.
  - once everyone is done, the agenda is made with the proposed ideas
  - If people want to keep the discussion going, just clear the room so you don't block a following session

## Time Management
- Notify participants of start/end times for sessions.
- Suggest moving discussions to new spaces if needed.
