## Introduction to Open Space Principles
What does it mean, an unconference.
it is based on the open space technology, which means there is no fixed agenda en the agenda is maded based on the input of the participants. 
Openspace is based on 4 principles and 1 law
1. **Whoever Comes Is the Right People**: Emphasize the value each person brings.
2. **Whatever Happens Is the Only Thing That Could Have**: Encourage openness to the flow of the event.
3. **When It Starts Is the Right Time**: Highlight the importance of spontaneity.
4. **When It’s Over, It’s Over**: Advise participants to respect the natural end of discussions.

## Law of Freedom
- Explain participants' empowerment to choose their sessions and move freely if they feel they are not learning or contributing.



### Marketplace
- Line out the number of rooms times the amount of slots.
- provide post its for the time slots, but don't fill them in already
- if there are rooms with beamers or other needed equipment, highlight those on the agenda
- Collaborative agenda-setting for breakout discussions.
  - Use post-its and markers for topic proposals.
  - Facilitate a process for presenting and selecting topics. People queue up, present 1 proposal for session, if they have multiple, they re-queue
  - All post-its are placed inside the parking, not on the schedule
  - once everyone is done, the agenda is made with the proposed ideas. You can pull in the ideas from the parking lot to the agenda
  - If people want to keep the discussion going, just clear the room so you don't block a following session

## Time Management
- Notify participants of start/end times for sessions.
- Suggest moving discussions to new spaces if needed.
